        Args:
            request: The request to allocate slots.
            num_new_tokens: The number of tokens to allocate, including external
                tokens. Note that this does not include tokens that have
                already been computed locally (i.e. new_computed_blocks).
            num_new_computed_tokens: The number of new computed tokens just
                hitting the prefix caching, excluding external tokens.
            new_computed_blocks: The cached blocks for the above new computed
                tokens.
            num_lookahead_tokens: The number of speculative tokens to allocate.
                This is used by spec decode proposers with kv-cache such
                as eagle.
            delay_cache_blocks: Whether to skip caching the blocks. This is
                used by P/D when allocating blocks used in a KV transfer
                which will complete in a future step.

        ```
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        | < computed > | < new computed > |    < new >    | < pre-allocated > |
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
